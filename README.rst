- I'm not stupid 
- I don't want to be limited by some idiotic ``people that write templates are stupid`` rule.
- I don't want to learn yet another template language.

- I want all the power of indexing, attribute resolution and performing operations that golang offers.
- I want to type less stuff and do more.
- I want to include other templates in my template. (jinja?)
- I want to extend templates.
